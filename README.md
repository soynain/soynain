ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is MoisÃ©s Nain, some friends call me Moi, others Nain, as you please.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a fullstack developer updated with the last IT tendencies. I have knowledge of 
orchestrated processes, microservices orchestration, API designs, database designs
and some beginner notions of ETL data processing.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested in sharpening my Java skills, I haven't touched that language
in quite a time. Spring boot is in my interest.

Next topics I want to learn are:
- CI/CD Deplyments (currently learning with jenkins)
- Mobile development (In a future)

No matter how long it takes, I like to be digging into everything.

ðŸ“« If you wish to propose some hobby project to work together and working our skills up, 
you can catch me by sending me a message to:
