ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is MoisÃ©s Nain, some friends call me Moi, others Nain, as you please.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in backend programming topics, design patterns and technologies, I like
to handle and retrieve data, designing databases, creating services based on
requirements,etc. 

Also I have little notions on front end development, writting HTML and css is not
so difficult to me, but in front end I wish to be upgrading my skills to become
fullstash at certain point of my career.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java Spring Boot, MongoDB, rabbit MQ and redis. My next topics to learn are
- Microservices
- Software arquitecture patterns and bases
- Machine learning, data science and AI field (cuz I'm kinda good into Mysql where
  it comes to cleaning data)
- CI/CD
- UX/UI
- SVG design

No matter how long it takes, I like to be digging into everything.

ðŸ“« If you wish to propose some hobby project to work together and working our skills up, 
you can catch me by sending me a message to:
