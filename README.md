👋 Hi, my name is Moisés Nain, but you can call me god

👀 I’m a Java tech lead with experience on big monolitic systems with
processes orchestrations and also microservices, from design to deployment.

From a diversity of business logics, I consider myself to be adaptable to any kind of business
and code as well. Be confortable to check my humble git profile hehe :p

Doesn't matter if there's some topic I don't know, I'll cach it sooner or later, 
being focused on challenges where there's something new to learn has been my most 
strong skill.
