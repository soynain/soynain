ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is MoisÃ©s Nain, but you can call me god

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Java tech lead with experience on big monolitic systems with
processes orchestrations and also microservices, from design to deployment.
Also I have notions on ETL proceeses (yes you sneaky guys, I saw the datastage codes ;) )

Doesn't matter if there's some topic I don't know, I'll cach it sooner or later, 
being focused on challenges where there's something new to learn has been my most 
strong skill.
